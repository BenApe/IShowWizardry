Version 0.2.3 (Prerelease)

Changelog:
    Inventory:
    - Fishing now adds fish to a global inventory
    - Eventually, you'll be able to view your spells with the inventory command
    - Inventory command is set up to allow multiple different inventories, so if other things are tracked in the future, theyll show up in inventory

    Banned Users:
    - Added a banned users class so users can be banned from doomscroll (still not done) if their message contains profanity
